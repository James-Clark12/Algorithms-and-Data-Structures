Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy.

Remember Greedy Algorithms are just a type/ strategy of algorithm, they are just one of many forms algorithms may take - e.g.:

Some commonly-used techniques are:

Divide and conquer
Randomized algorithms
Greedy algorithms (This is not an algorithm, it is a technique.)
Dynamic programming
