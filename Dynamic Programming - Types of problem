Dynamic Programming - Types of problem

1.  Finding the Min/ Max path to a target

Classic examples

-climbing stairs - https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/
-coin change - https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/
-minimum cost of tickets - https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/

One of the simpler set of problems imo.

Use top-down and memoization to find the max/ min route. This should define the relation
that can be used in tabulation. dp[i] will be the max/ min of some previous i's 
depending on the recurrence relation defined.


2. Finding the number of unique paths to something

Classic examples

-climing stairs - no. of ways - https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
-unique paths - https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
-Combination sum - https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/

Very similar to finding the max/ min path to a target - except you summ the number
of routes that make it to the target.

3. Longest Increasing Subsequence

This might not initially seem like a DP problem but it is. The reason being that for some i in the
array - the length of the increasing subsequence to it - is the largest LIS up to any element
before it that is smaller than it.

i.e. the relation is:

LIS[i] = Math.max(1, LIS[j]) <-- where j is an index before i, and LIS[j] is an element smaller than LIS[i]
