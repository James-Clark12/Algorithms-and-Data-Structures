Dynamic Programming - Types of problem

1.  Finding the Min/ Max path to a target

Classic examples

-climbing stairs - https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/
-coin change - https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/
-minimum cost of tickets - https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/

One of the simpler set of problems imo.

User top-down and memoization to find the max/ min route. This should define the relation
that can be used in tabulation. dp[i] will be the max/ min of some previous i's 
depending on the recurrence relation defined.
