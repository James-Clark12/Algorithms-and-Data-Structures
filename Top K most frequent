These are a common question set where you are given some set of data and asked to return the k most frequent instances of an element appearing:

solving is simple:

1. use hashmap to count frequency of instances

and then either:

a). use a efficient quicksort where you sort data but cut out everything but the k elements you care about

b). use a max heap
