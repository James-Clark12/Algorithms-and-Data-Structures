Once you realise a question is graph based don't immediately think about creating a graph to represent it. Think about what the question is asking
and any constraints the questions impose on the graph structure. This may allow you to solve the problem without needing to implement a graph.

In graph theory, we say the outdegree of a vertex (person) is the number of directed edges going out of it. For this graph, the outdegree of the
vertex represents the number of other people that person trusts.

Likewise, we say that the indegree of a vertex (person) is the number of directed edges going into it. So here, it represents the number of people
trusted by that person.

These two definitions are important as sometimes the vertex we are looking for can be defined in terms of its outdegree and indegree.
